#Final strategy for bait design involving RLP, RLK and SRLK genes.
#Cluster the nucleotide (protein?) sequences at different levels of sequence identity and take
#represenative contig. Design the bait to the contigs at 5x density and count up the total number
#of baits. Stop when reaching >100,000 baits in total.
