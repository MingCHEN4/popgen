#The top match is located in the protein EAA34064, which is gene NCU08457, which is
#ccg2, which agrees with expectations. It is on plus strand, but situated
#between 767 and 834 bp from the beginning of a 1000 bp promoter, ie.
#between -233 and -166 bp from TSS. This agrees with GFF annotation on Ensembl
#but not with the experimental data (see above). Also, the hit is not perfect but the best by an order of magnitude
